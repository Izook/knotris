          The following is the result of an
          <a href="http://urmath.org/curm/">CURM</a> sponsored undergraduate
          research project conducted by Dr. Allison Henrich, Alexandra Ionescu,
          Brooke Mathews, Isaac Ortega, and Kelemua Tesfaye in the 2019-20
          academic year.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we began our research we thought we were going to work on pure
          math research (you know, making conjectures, proving theorems, and
          such). Our work was meant to involve the study of knot mosaics. Knot
          mosaics were first introduced by Lomonaco and Kauffman in 2008
          [LomKau] in order to build a quantum knot system. But these
          interesting objects attracted a lot of interest in the math community,
          not necessarily because of their applications in quantum knot theory,
          but because they‚Äôre interesting combinatorial objects to play with and
          ask questions about.
        </p>
        <p>
          In trying to formulate some new questions about knot mosaics and
          consider strategies for finding their answers, our team took some time
          to play. We were able to get our hands on a big bag of woodcut mosaic
          tiles made by Lew Ludwig for the UnKnot Conference, and we made some
          of our own. So, for several weeks in the fall, we would spend a part
          of our research time physically playing with these tiles to build
          intuition and formulate questions. One day, as we were talking about
          some potential research questions and playing idly with our
          tiles‚Äîtrying to make collections of tiles be suitably connected‚Äîwe
          realized that this simple act was actually pretty fun. ‚ÄúIf we think
          putting together tiles in a suitably connected way is fun, maybe
          others would too!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if we created a game‚Äîkind of like Tetris‚Äîthat
          used knot mosaic tiles instead of tetrominoes?‚Äù [TETRIS] And that was
          how our project was born. We dabbled in our pure math research and
          associated programming projects for several weeks after this idea came
          about, but quickly, it became clear to us that working to develop
          Knotris should be our new goal.
